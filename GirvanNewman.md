# :mushroom: Girvan Newman Algorithm 

Girvan Newman is a divisive community detection algorithm . In this algorithm we iteratively eleminate the edges that have the hoghest number of shortest paths between nodes passing through it. By doing this the network breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces and these would be the communities.


The idea is to find which edges in a network occur most frequently between other pairs of nodes by finding edge betweenness centrailities. The edges joining communities are then expected to have a high edge betweenness. The underlying community structure of the network will be much more fine-grained once the edges with the highest betweenness are eliminated which means that communities will be much easier to spot.


### Implementation 
The Girvan-Newman algorithm can be divided into four main steps:

1. Calculate the edge betweenness centrality for all the nodes in the graph
2. Remove the edge with the highest betweenness centrality.
3. Calculate the betweenness centrality for every remaining edge.
4. Repeat steps 2â€“4 until there are no more edges left.

### Applications of community detection algorithms
Because networks are an integral part of many real-world problems, community detection algorithms have found their way into various fields, ranging from social network analysis to public health initiatives.

- A known use case is the detection of terrorist groups in social networks by tracking their activities and interactions. Similarly, groups of malicious bots can be detected on online social platforms.
- Community detection can be used to study the dynamics of certain groups that are susceptible to epidemic diseases. Other types of diseases can be studied similarly to discover common links among patients.
- One of the most recent use cases, community evolution prediction, involves the prediction of changes in network structures.
