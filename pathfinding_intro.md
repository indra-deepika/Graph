# :four_leaf_clover: Introduction to pathfinding algorithms

Pathfinding alogorithms are built with the help of graph search algorithms , they explore the routes or  paths that exist between 2 nodes or vertices until the destination is reached. These algorithms are useful findout out optimal paths. 

We are going to see the following algortihms:

1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. Dijkstra (Shortest path algorithm)
4. Floyd Warshall (All pairs shortest path)
5. Shortest Path in a DAG
6. Minimum Spanning Tree and Kruskals Algorithm
7. Applications of Shortest path algorithm and All pairs shortest path
