# Community Detection Algorithm

In all types of networks we see the formation of communitites and indetifying these communitites helps us better undersstand the behaviours of these groups like  preferences of peer groups, estimate resiliency, find nested relationships etc.

The general rule while trying to figure out a community is that the nodes in the community have more relationships within the community that outside of it.

Community detection techniques are useful for social media algorithms to discover people with common interests and keep them tightly connected. Community detection can be used in machine learning to detect groups with similar properties and extract groups for various reasons. For example, this technique can be used to discover manipulative groups inside a social network or a stock market. It also allows further to infer special relationships between the nodes that may not be easily accessible from direct empirical tests and it helps to better understand the properties of dynamic processes taking place in a network.
