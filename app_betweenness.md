# :rose: Betweenness Centrality Applications

Betweenness Centrality applies to a wide range of problems in real-world networks.
We use it to find bottlenecks, control points, and vulnerabilities.

Example use cases include:

- Identifying influencers in various organizations. Powerful individuals are not
necessarily in management positions, but can be found in “brokerage positions”
using Betweenness Centrality. Removal of such influencers can seriously destabi‐
lize the organization. This might be considered a welcome disruption by law
enforcement if the organization is criminal, or could be a disaster if a business
loses key staff it underestimated. More details are found in “Brokerage Qualifica‐
tions in Ringing Operations”, by C. Morselli and J. Roy.

-  Uncovering key transfer points in networks such as electrical grids. Counterin‐
tuitively, removal of specific bridges can actually improve overall robustness by
“islanding” disturbances. Research details are included in “Robustness of the
European Power Grids Under Intentional Attack”, by R. Solé, et al.

- Helping microbloggers spread their reach on Twitter, with a recommendation
engine for targeting influencers. This approach is described in a paper by S. Wu
et al., “Making Recommendations in a Microblog to Improve the Impact of a
Focal User”.
