# :herb:  Centrality
While analysing a graph Centrality is a very important concept in identifying the importantant nodes (how "central" the node is to the graph). The importance can be of various types  and ech metric defines importance of a node from different perspectives.

Centrality algorithms are used to understand the roles of paticular nodes in a graph and the impact that they have on that network. They help us in understanding what the important nodes are and help us better understand groupo dynamics such as credibility , accesibility , the speed at which things spread and bridges between the groups. 

We are going to discuss the following :

1. Degree Centrality
2. Closenness Centrality
3. Betweennes Centrality
4. Page Rank 
5. Applications of centrality
