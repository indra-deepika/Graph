# :snowflake: Closeness Centrality Application 


We apply Closeness Centrality when you need to know which nodes disperse things
the fastest. Using weighted relationships can be especially helpful in evaluating interaction speeds in communication and behavioral analyses.

Case studies:

- Uncovering individuals in very favorable positions to control and acquire vital
information and resources within an organization. One such study is “Mapping
Networks of Terrorist Cells”, by V. E. Krebs.

-  As a heuristic for estimating arrival time in telecommunications and package
delivery, where content flows through the shortest paths to a predefined target. It
is also used to shed light on propagation through all shortest paths simultane‐
ously, such as infections spreading through a local community. Find more details
in “Centrality and Network Flow”, by S. P. Borgatti.

- Evaluating the importance of words in a document, based on a graph-based key‐
phrase extraction process. This process is described by F. Boudin in “A Compari‐
son of Centrality Measures for Graph-Based Keyphrase Extraction”.
