# Overview

 In this project I have tried to basic terminology of graphs , 3 different types of graph algorithms ie: 
 1. Pathfinding and Graph search Algorithms
 2. Centrality Algorithms
 3. Community Detection Algorithms 
I tried to cover the basics of dynamic and greedy and the  correlated  graph algorithms.

Terminology 

Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. BFS
2. DFS
3. Dijstra
4. Floyd Warshall
5. Kruskal
6. Shortestpath DAG
7. Intro to pathfinding

Centrality Algorithms:
1. Intro to centrality algorithms
2. Degree Centrality
3. Closenness Centrality
4. Betweennes Centrality
5. Page Rank
6. Applications of centrality

Communtity Detection algorithms
1. Intro to Community Detection Algorithms
2. Clustering Coefficients
3. Girvan Newman Algorithm
4. Bridges and Atriculation points
5. Applications of community detecting algorithms

Introduction to Dynamic programming and Greedy algorithms
